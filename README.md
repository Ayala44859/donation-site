React Donations Campaign Project
A Single Page Application (SPA) built with React and Vite, simulating a fundraising campaign page. This application allows users to view campaign details, make donations, and see a real-time list of all contributions.
✨ Key Features
Progress Tracking: A visual progress bar displays the total amount raised against the campaign's goal.
Multi-Currency Display: Users can toggle the view between Israeli Shekels (₪) and US Dollars ($). All monetary values (total sum, goal, and individual donations) are converted based on a real-time exchange rate fetched from an external API.
Donation Form: An interactive form to add new donations, complete with basic client-side validation for required fields (name and amount).
Dynamic Donation List:
Displays all submitted donations.
Search: Filter the list in real-time by donor's name.
Sort: Sort the list by donation amount or date (newest to oldest and vice versa).
Data Persistence: Utilizes the browser's localStorage to save the donation list and total amount, ensuring data persists across page reloads.
Client-Side Routing: Employs React Router for seamless navigation between the donation list and the donation form pages without a full page refresh.
